                I contributed to research and develop a multi-speaker TTS system that can generate various idols' voices (about 100 idols) in one TTS system. The TTS systems are used in following two services included in UNIVERSE. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                1. Fan Networking Service (FNS):
                The K-pop idols write a post with photos and short comments (like Instagram), and the TTS system reads these comments in the idols' voices. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                2. Private Call:
                Provides fake phones calls to the fans with their favorite idols’ voices. The TTS system was used to generate the voice of idols’ phone calls.
